  <h3>A Brief Note On Sanskrit</h3>

  <p>Considering that I have chosen to leave many Sanskrit terms untranslated, I figured I might say a few things about the language. In order to keep this as concise as possible I’ve referenced a few resources at the end of this section that explore Sanskrit in much greater depth that I would highly recommend.</p>

  <p>Firstly, the reason I and many others choose to use original Sanskrit terms is the fact that Sanskrit is a perfect language. I’m not only referring to the traditional idea that Sanskrit was not devised by human minds but was given to humanity and is comprised of the sounds of the universe. Also not that the word Sanskrit itself comes from joining samyak meaning “perfect” or “well” with krit meaning “made.” I’m talking more specifically about the fact that Sanskrit is the only language on the planet that is a context-free grammar. This means that it is entirely unambiguous because every sentence can be derived from a set of rules and requires no context or common sense.</p>

  <p>The most common example I’ve seen is in comparing the two English sentences “fruit flies like an apple” and “time flies like an arrow.” Even though they are lexically identical, they are contextually different to a human reader. “Flies” is a noun in the first sentence and a verb in the second and “like” also has a different meaning in each sentence. A reader must be familiar with both the language and the context to understand these differences. Now the really cool thing is that such sentences are impossible to write in Sanskrit. Because of the rules of the language, word order is not even an issue. With a very specific system for verb conjugation and noun relationships, sentences can always be interpreted correctly grammatically.</p>

  <p>Another amazing thing about Sanskrit is that it’s sounds use the full range of the human vocal palette and its syntax encourages maximum resonance whereas many spoken languages only partially employ these capabilities. This is one reason why chanting in Sanskrit is encouraged.</p>

  <p>Another choice I have made in this document is to include diacritical markings to be clear about pronunciation of the Sanskrit terms. Let’s take this a bite at a time. First of all, what is a diacritic? A diacritic, or diacritical mark is a sign above or below a letter that indicates a different pronunciation than the same letter with no sign or a different sign. So why do we need them? Sanskrit can be written in any script that has a distinct character for each sound. You are reading this in the Roman alphabet and because you are familiar with the sounds each character of the alphabet makes, you can pronounce these words. So rather than learning a new script to read or write Sanskrit, we can romanize the language and use the familiar characters to represent the phonemes.</p>

  <p>But the problem now arises that there are twenty three letters in the roman alphabet and forty six Sanskrit phonemes (I’ve seen one reference to there being fifty two. Need to confirm the contradiction.). Rather than make up new characters we can add markings to existing characters. For example, you might be familiar with the word savasana and may have seen it spelled shavasana. So assuming someone had never heard the term, how would they actually know how to pronounce this? The second version gets an English speaker closer but we can do better. The same word with diacritical markings is written śavāsana. This is all of the information meaning no more guessing. The “ś” sounds like the sh in the word “shut” and the “ā” means that that one is pronounced long...so by comparison we also know that all of the other “a”s are short. I’ve included a reference chart to these markings in the resources at the end of the section.</p>

  <p>This may have all seemed self explanatory on such a familiar term or maybe it didn’t, but believe me, if you can put a little effort into learning the diacriticals you’ll feel much more certain about your Sanskrit pronunciation and wonder how anyone gets by without them. I can tell you how actually. They mispronounce things a lot!</p>
