<h3>A Brief Note On Sanskrit</h3>

<p>Considering I have chosen to leave many Sanskrit terms untranslated, I figured I might say a few things about the language. In order to keep this concise I’ve included a few resources at the end of this section should you wish to explore Sanskrit in greater depth.</p>

<p>Firstly, the reason why it is widely preferred to use original Sanskrit terms is to avoid the inherent and unfortunate ambiguity all other languages and especially interpretation in translation pose. Besides, Sanskrit is considered a perfect language. I’m not only referring to the traditional idea that Sanskrit was not devised by human minds but was given to humanity and is comprised of the sounds of the universe. Also not that the word Sanskrit itself comes from joining <i>saṃ</i> meaning “perfect” or “well” with <i>kṛ</i> meaning “make” and the past participle ending <i>-ta</i> implying that this language has been "made perfect." But I am talking more specifically about the fact that Sanskrit is the only language on the planet that is a context-free grammar. This means that it is entirely unambiguous because every sentence can be derived from a set of rules and requires no context or common sense.</p>

<p>The most straightforward example I’ve seen is in comparing the two English sentences “fruit flies like an apple” and “time flies like an arrow.” Even though they are lexically identical, they are contextually different. The word “flies” is a noun in the first sentence and a verb in the second and “like” also has a different meaning in each sentence. A reader must have some familiarity with both the language and the context to understand these differences. Now the really cool thing is that such sentences are impossible to write in Sanskrit. Because the rules of the language prevent this ambiguity, word order is not even an issue. With a very specific system for verb conjugation and noun relationships, sentences can always be interpreted grammatically correct.</p>

<p>When it comes to speaking Sanskrit, the sounds of the language use the full range of the human vocal palette and its syntax encourages maximum resonance whereas many spoken languages only partially employ either of these possibilities. This is one reason why chanting in Sanskrit and not translations is encouraged.</p>

<p>Another choice I have made in this document is to include diacritical markings to be clear about pronunciation. Let’s take this a bite at a time. First of all, what is a diacritical marking? A diacritic, or diacritical mark is a sign above or below a letter that indicates a different pronunciation than the same letter with no sign or a different sign. Why do we need them? Sanskrit can be written in any script that has a distinct character for each sound. You are reading this in the Roman alphabet and because you are familiar with the sounds each character represents, you can pronounce these words. So rather than learning a new script to read or write Sanskrit, we can romanize the language and use these familiar characters to represent the phonemes of Sanskrit.</p>

<p>But the problem now arises that there are twenty three letters in the roman alphabet and forty six Sanskrit phonemes. (I’ve seen one reference to there being fifty two. Need to confirm the contradiction.) Rather than make up new characters we can add markings to existing characters to account for the additional sounds. For example, you might be familiar with the word <i>savasana</i> and may have seen it spelled <i>shavasana</i>. But assuming someone had never heard the term, how would they actually know how to pronounce this? The second version gets an English speaker closer but we can do better. The same word with diacritical markings is written <i>śavāsana</i>. This is all of the information meaning no more guessing. The “ś” sounds like the sh in the word “shut” and the “ā” is pronounced long; by comparison we now know that all of the other “a”s are short. I’ve included a reference chart to these markings in the resources at the end of the section.</p>

<p>This may have all seemed self explanatory or maybe it didn’t, but believe me, if you put a little effort into learning to the diacritical markings I promise you will feel much more certain about your Sanskrit pronunciation and wonder how anyone gets by without them. I can tell you how actually. They mispronounce things a lot!</p>
