This mantra is traditionally chanted at the end of a practice before _Śavāsana_. I have seen it referred to as _Mangalya Prarthana_—Universal Prayer to well being—however, the origin of the mantra has evaded my query for quite some time now. Many claim that is is from the Rig Veda but my search has proven this incorrect. Regardless, it is a beautiful sentiment.

## Mantra

<p class="sk-pre sk-dev">ॐ
स्वस्तिप्रजाभ्यः परिपालयन्तां न्यायेन मार्गेण महीं महीशाः ।
गोब्राह्मणेभ्यः शुभमस्तु नित्यं लोकाः समस्ताः सुखिनो भवन्तु ॥
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः
</p>

<p class="sk-pre sk-rom">Oṃ
svasti prajābhyaḥ paripālayantāṁ nyāyena mārgeṇa mahīṁ mahīśāḥ ।
gobrāhmaṇebhyaḥ śubhamastu nityaṁ lokāḥ samastāḥ sukhino bhavantu ॥
Oṃ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ
</p>

<p class="sk-pre">Om
May all be well with mankind, may the leaders of the earth protect in every way by keeping to the right path.
May there be goodness for those who know the earth to be sacred, may all the worlds be happy.
Om peace peace peace
</p>
