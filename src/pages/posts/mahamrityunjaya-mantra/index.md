Also referred to as Rudra Mantra or Tryambakam Mantra, it occurs in three of the ancient Vedic scriptures – Rig Veda ([7.59.12](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv07059.htm)), Yajur Veda ([3.60](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/wyv/wyvbk03.htm)), and Atharva Veda ([14.17](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/av/av14001.htm)). Roughly translated, _maha_ means "great," _mṛtyun_ means "death," and _jaya_ means "conquering." It is a beckoning to Śiva. This mantra has many purposed benefits but was given to me in the context of removing negative emotion associated with death.

## Mantra

त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् ।
उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान् मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात् ॥

<p class="sk-pre sk-rom">Oṃ
tryambakaṁ yajāmahe sugandhiṁ puṣṭivardhanam ।

<p class="sk-pre">Om
We worship the three-eyed One, who is fragrant and who nourishes all.
Like the fruit falls off from the bondage of the stem, may we be liberated from death, from mortality.
