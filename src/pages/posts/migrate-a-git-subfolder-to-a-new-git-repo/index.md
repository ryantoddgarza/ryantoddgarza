I recently needed to move several packages from subfolders in a monorepo to individual repositories while retaining the history of each package. It turned out to be a relatively painless process.

_Requires Git >= 1.7.11_

1. Split the original repo

```shell
cd </path/to/orig-repo>
git subtree split -P <name-of-folder> -b <name-of-new-branch>
```

2. Pull into the new repo

```shell
mkdir ~/<new-repo>
cd ~/<new-repo>
git init
git pull </path/to/orig-repo> <name-of-new-branch>
```

3. Done! From here you can proceed in whatever way fits your use caseâ€”add a remote, delete the original subfolder, etc.
