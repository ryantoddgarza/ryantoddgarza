summary: 'By deriving "child" meters one branch at a time, new grids will always be relatable in some way to the first "parent" meter no matter how many new derivations have been made....'

## Concept

Without leaving a static meter, how can we improvise/compose over more rhythmically interesting grids?

- Quantify the given meter as subdivisions of big beats and phrase groups. For example: common time is composed of quarter notes (big beats) in groupings of 4 (phrase) with subdivisions defined by the "feel." Duple meter feel yields 8th/16th/32nd/etc. note subdivisions and triple meter feel yields triplets/sextuplets/duodectuplets etc.
- Determine which of those elements will be the reference (key) for a new grid
- Divide, multiply or regroup the key
- Repeat

By recursively deriving "child" meters, new grids will always relate in some way to the initial "parent" meter regardless of the number of derivations. So I suppose that technically over iterations you can think of the first meter as the "great-grandparent" or the "great-great-great-great-grandparent" and the route can always be traced back from the most recent child to the original meter.

This opens many improvisational/compositional possibilities in multiple meters at once.
