## Concept

Without leaving common time how can we improvise/compose more rhythmically interesting grids?

- Quantify the given meter into subdivisions, big beats, and phrase groups. For example: common time is generally composed of quarter notes (big beats) in groupings of 4 (phrase) with subdivisions defined by the "feel." Duple meter feel yields 8th/16th/32nd/etc. note subdivisions and triple meter feel yields triplets/sextuplets/duodectuplets etc.
- Determine which of those elements you would like to reference a new grid from (key)
- Divide, multiply or regroup the key
- Repeat

By deriving "child" meters one branch at a time, new grids will always be relatable in some way to the first "parent" meter no matter how many new derivations have been made. So in some cases I suppose it would be more technically correct to call the first meter the "great-grandparent" or the "great-great-great-great-grandparent." This opens many improvisational/compositional possibilities in multiple meters at once.
