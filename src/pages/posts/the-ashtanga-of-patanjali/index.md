The _Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali_ are a condensed and systematic exposition of the essential philosophy and technique of Yoga in 196 _sūtras_ (aphorisms). Because the text is inherently cryptic, it requires a great deal of unpacking and interpretation. It has therefore been recommended by my teacher Noah Williams not as a guide but as a resource for gaining familiarity with Yogic terms so that as certain experiences unfold, there is some context for what is occurring.

The _Sūtras_ begin with a succinct definition of Yoga in no more than four terms — _yogaś-citta-vṛtti-nirodhaḥ_. The remaining one hundred ninety-four sutras are an explication of this declaration. Patañjali goes on to describe _aṣṭāṅga_ (Eight Limbs) — _yama_, _niyama_, _asana_, _pranayama_, _pratyahara_, _dharana_, _dhyana_, and _samadhi_ — and _trimārga_ (Three Paths) — _karma_, _jnana_, and _bhakti_.

### Yogas Chitta Vritti Nirodhah

> Yoga is the suppression of the modifications of the mind.[^1]

<p class="sk-pre sk-dev">योगश्चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः ॥२॥</p>

<p class="sk-pre sk-rom">yogaścittavṛttinirodhaḥ ॥2॥</p>

**_yoga_** derived from _yuj_ - To contemplate. Both a state and a mental process not of joining but of liberating the absolute from the worldly or _puruṣa_ from _prakṛti_.

- yuj युज् - Concentration of the mind, in cessation of the modification of the thinking principle. (_yujir samādhau_ not _yujir yoge_).[^2] [^3]
- samādhau समाधौ - in the controlled mind.
- yoge योगे - work without fruitive result.

**_citta_** derived from _cit_ - Consciousness, the mind. Later one of three aspects of _patamārmā_ called _sat-cit-ānanda_ [^4]

- sat सत् - Being, existing.
- cit चित् - Consciousness, absolute knowledge.
- ānanda आनन्द - Pleasure, bliss, ecstasy.

**_vṛtti_** derived from _vṛt_ - Contextually means activities, functionings. (YS1.6-11)

- vṛt वृत् - To exist.

**_nirodhaḥ_** derived from _niruddham_: Restrained, controlled, inhibited. (YS3.9)

- ni नि - (a) Implying certainty, absoluteness, of an enhancing power. Frequently redundant. (b) Cessation, restraint.
- ruddha रुद्ध - Obstructed, stopped, blocked, suppressed.

### The Eight Limbs

When people talk about the "eight limbs of yoga," it is most likely the section of the _Sūtras_ beginning at 2.29 to which they refer.

<p class="sk-pre sk-dev">यमनियमासनप्राणायामप्रत्याहारधारणाध्यानसमाधयाोऽष्टावङानि ॥२९॥</p>

<p class="sk-pre sk-rom">yama-niyamāsana-prāṇāyāma-pratyāhāra-dhāraṇā-dhyāna-samādhayo’ṣṭāv aṅgāni ॥29॥</p>

Transliteration:

- Yama (यम, yama) - abstentions
- Niyama (नियम​, niyama) - observances
- Asana (आसन​, āsana) - posture
- Pranayama (प्राणायाम, prāṇāyāma) - control of prana
- Pratyahara (प्रत्याहार, pratyāhāra) - abstraction
- Dharana (धारणा, dhāraṇā) - concentration
- Dhyana (ध्यान, dhyāna) - contemplation
- Samadhi (समाधि, samādhi) - absorption
- Ashta (अष्ट, aṣṭa) - eight
- Angani (अङ्ग​, aṅgāni) - limbs, branches.

The first five limbs are considered _bahiraṅga_ (external) and the last three are _antaraṅga_ (internal). Each constituent is elaborated upon in the following sutras but this one line reveals the systematic steps of the Yoga system that can take lifetimes to understand let alone perfect.

#### Yama - abstention

(YS 2.30)

1. Ahimsa - nonviolence
2. Satya - truthfulness
3. Asteya - abstention from stealing
4. Brahmacharya - continence
5. Aparigraha - nonacquisitiveness

#### Niyama - observance

(YS 2.32)

1. Saucha - purity
2. Santosha - contentment
3. Tapaha - austerity
4. Svadhyaya - self-study
5. Ishvara pranidhana - devotion

#### Asana - posture

(YS 2.46-48)

Even though it appears to be modern society's primary infatuation with Yoga, Patañjali mentions _āsana_ just once and devotes only three sutras to the topic of _āsana_ in the entirety of the _Yoga Sūtras_. Regardless, several systems of _āsana_ have been developed throughout history that view the body in different ways.

In an overly simplistic analysis, Hatha-Yoga identifies the physical body as a tool while Raja-Yoga identifies it as an obstacle.

“Hatha-Yoga is based upon the principle that changes in consciousness can be brought about by setting in motion currents of certain kinds of subtler forces...in the physical body. The first step in contacting the deeper levels of consciousness is...to make the physical body perfectly healthy and fit for the influx and manipulation of these forces.”[^5]

“In Raja-Yoga...the method adopted for bringing about changes in consciousness is based essentially on the control of the mind by the Will and the gradual suppression of the Citta-Vṛttis...So the Yogi must eliminate completely the disturbances which arise from the physical body before he tries to tackle the problem of the mind itself.”[^6]

And the Tibetan Yogi Milarepa explains, “I have understood that this material body, made of flesh and blood along with mental consciousness, is gathered together by the twelve chains of cause and effect—one of which is volition—originating from ignorance. This body is the blessed vessel for those fortunate beings who wish for freedom, but it also leads sinners into the lower realms. I understand that in this body lies the vital choice between enormous profit and loss, relating to eternal happiness or misery on the border between good and evil…”[^7]

B.K.S. Iyengar comments that perfection of _āsana_ brings about the divine union of puruṣa and prakṛti through the unifying of the various sheaths of body and self.[^8]

#### Pranayama - prana control

(YS 2.49-53)

_Prāṇāyāma_ is often seen translated as "breath control." This is fine as an elementary explanation but lacks the depth of its intent. The breath is merely our most visceral experience of _prāṇa_ in the body and therefore the gross mechanism used.

_Prāṇa_ is a word that has no definitive equivalent in English. It can be conceptualized as the infinite and omnipresent manifesting power or energy in the universe. In a dualistic framework, it is the counterpart to _ākāśa_—the infinite, omnipresent material of the universe.

On February 10, 2020, I spoke with my teacher Noah Williams about the best time to do _prāṇāyāma_. Noah said that Guruji taught to wait 20 minutes after _āsana_—no sooner—and that _prāṇāyāma_ is only to be practiced during Brahma Muhūrta—approximately one and a half hours before sunrise when the air is coolest and most oxygenated since the trees and plants “exhale” at this time. Noah added that _prāṇāyāma_ before _āsana_ is also an option. When I asked if he teaches prāṇāyāma, Noah responded that he makes people practice 20 years of _āsana_ before teaching _prāṇāyāma_. After 30 years it can become a focus and after 40 years it can take priority over _āsana_. For the first 40 years, _āsana_ should be priority. He said, “Āsana _is_ prāṇāyāma when done correctly. If you cheat in āsana, then prāṇāyāma will cause lots of anxiety.”

> Āsana is prāṇāyāma when done correctly. If you cheat in āsana, then prāṇāyāma will cause lots of anxiety.
> <cite>— Noah Williams</cite>

#### Pratyahara - abstraction

(YS 2.54-55)

The withdrawal of the senses.

#### Dharana - concentration

(YS 3.1)

Holding the mind on a single point.

#### Dhyana - contemplation

(YS 3.2)

A state of meditation.

#### Samadhi - absorption

(YS 3.3)

A merging with the object of meditation.

### The Three Paths

Patañjali posits three _mārgas_ meaning literally “paths.”

- _karma-mārga_ - path of action (YS 2.30-45)
- _jñana-mārga_ - path of knowledge (YS 2.46-55)
- _bhakti-mārga_ - path of devotion (YS 3.1-4)

> “On hearing that excellent story that heightened devotion, knowledge and detachment and yielded liberation, she became greatly blessed.” - Śivapurāṇa-māhātmya 4.32
