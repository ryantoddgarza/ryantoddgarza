The opening mantra is traditionally chanted before _Sūrya Namaskār_ and the closing mantra before _Śavāsana_. Some of the mantras that follow do not pertain necessarily to the Ashtanga tradition but were given to me by a teacher at various times in my life when they seemed appropriate.

The format that follows scales from most unadulterated to most opinionated. First the Sanskrit mantra in Devanagari, the romanized transliteration, a generally accepted English translation, and finally a brief explanation. My own transliterations are at the end of the section to aid in discerning ambiguity one might find with the various translations one might find.

Although the chants we voice in Ashtanga are not by definition Vedic Mantra, in the Vedic chanting tradition of India exists a profound distillation of the feats of human language and mnemonic devices. Just as the Sanskrit language has stood the test of time because of its meticulous rules, so has Vedic mantra been passed down unchanged due to precise methods of instruction and recitation.

This type of mantra hinges on correctness of varṇaḥ (pronunciation), svaraḥ (notes), mātra (duration), balam (emphasis), sāma (continuity), santānaḥ (punctuation).[^1] It should be made clear that Vedic mantra is not music. In fact, even some mantra in this system that has a more musical character than the others is considered inferior.

### Opening Mantra

वन्दे गुरूणां चरणारविन्दे संदर्शितस्वात्मसुखावबोधे ।<br>
निःश्रेयसे जाङ्गलिकायमणे संसारहालाहलमोहशान्त्यै ॥

आबाहुपुरुषाकारं शङ्खचक्रासिधारिणम् ।<br>
सहस्रशिरसं श्वेतं प्रणमामि पतञ्जलिम् ॥

_vande gurūṇāṁ charaṇāravinde sandarśita svātma sukhāva bodhe_ ।<br>
_niḥśreyase jāṅgalikāyamāne saṁsāra hālāhala moha śāntyai_ ॥

_ābāhu puruṣākāraṁ śankha cakrāsi dhāriṇam_ ।<br>
_sahasra śirasaṁ śvetaṁ praṇamāmi patañjalim_ ॥

I worship the Guru’s lotus feet<br>
Awakening the happiness of the self revealed<br>
Beyond comparison, acting like the jungle physician<br>
To pacify delusion from the poison of existence[^2]

Whose upper body has a human form,<br>
Whose arms hold a conch, a disc and a sword,<br>
Who is crowned by a thousand headed cobra (incarnation of Ādi Śeṣa)<br>
I prostrate before Patañjali [^3]

This mantra originates from two separate sources: The Yoga Tārāval of Adi Shankaracharya and Hymn to Patañjali which is often chanted prior to chanting the _Yoga Sūtras_. The first half acknowledges those who have come before us and have cultivated the practices in which can be realized the illusory nature of manifest existence. The second half pays reverence to the mythological form of Patañjali, believed to have been an incarnation of Ādi Śeṣa (transliterated as ādi-, prefix meaning “beginning” or “the first” and śeṣa meaning “residue” or “remainder”), a thousand-headed serpent and a primal being of creation in Hindu mythology. This etymology alludes to the philosophical idea that action leaves behind a “karmic residue” which propagates the necessity for further action and is thus a primal mover in the creation of experiential reality.

### Closing Mantra

स्वस्तिप्रजाभ्यः परिपालयन्तां न्यायेन मार्गेण महीं महीशाः ।<br>
गोब्राह्मणेभ्यः शुभमस्तु नित्यं लोकाः समस्ताः सुखिनो भवन्तु ॥<br>
ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः

_svasti prajābhyaḥ paripālayantāṁ nyāyena mārgeṇa mahīṁ mahīśāḥ_ ।<br>
_gobrāhmaṇebhyaḥ śubhamastu nityaṁ lokāḥ samastāḥ sukhino bhavantu_ ॥<br>
_Oṃ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ_ ॥

May all be well with mankind. May the leaders of the earth protect in every way by keeping to the right path.<br>
May there be goodness for those who know the earth to be sacred. May all the worlds be happy.<br>
Om peace peace peace

This mantra is traditionally chanted at the end of a practice before _Śavāsana_. I have seen it referred to as _Mangalya Prarthana_ – Universal Prayer to well being, however, the origin of the mantra has evaded my query for quite some time now. Many claim that is is from the Rig Veda but my search has proven this incorrect. Regardless, it is a beautiful sentiment.

### Bhadraṁ Śāntiḥ Mantra

भद्रं कर्णेभिः शर्णुयाम देवा भद्रं पश्येमाक्षभिर्यजत्राः ।<br>
सथिरैरङगैस्तुष्टुवांसस्तनूभिर्व्यशेमदेवहितं यदायुः ॥<br>
सवस्ति न इन्द्रो वर्द्धश्रवाः सवस्ति नः पुषा विश्ववेदाः ।<br>
सवस्ति नस्तार्क्ष्यो अरिष्टनेमिः सवस्ति नो बर्हस्पतिर्दधातु ॥

_bhadraṁ paśyemākṣabhir yajatrāḥ_<br>
_sthirairaṅgais tuṣṭuvāguṁsas tanūbhiḥ_<br>
_vyaśema devahitaṁ yadāyuḥ_<br>
_svasti na indro vṛddhaśravāḥ_<br>
_svasti naḥ pūṣā viśva vedah_<br>
_svasti nas tārkṣyo ariṣṭanemiḥ_<br>
_svasti no bṛhaspatir dadātu_

Pattabhi Jois writes about this mantra in both the _Yoga Mala_ (pp 37) and the _Sūrya Namaskāra_ booklet (pp 39). It originates from the Rig Veda ([1.89.8 & 6](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv01089.htm)). Jois describes it as "a prayer to God asking for the attainment of a high degree of mental concentration." – _dhāraṇā_.

### Mahamrityunjaya Mantra

ॐ त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् ।<br>
उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान् मृत्योर्मुक्षीय मामृतात् ॥

_Oṃ tryambakaṁ yajāmahe sugandhiṁ puṣṭivardhanam_ ।<br>
_urvārukamiva bandhanān mṛtyormukṣīya māmṛtāt_

Om We worship the three-eyed One, who is fragrant and who nourishes all.<br>
Like the fruit falls off from the bondage of the stem, may we be liberated from death, from mortality.

Also referred to as Rudra Mantra or Tryambakam Mantra, it occurs in three of the ancient Vedic scriptures – Rig Veda ([7.59.12](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rvsan/rv07059.htm)), Yajur Veda ([3.60](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/wyv/wyvbk03.htm)), and Atharva Veda ([14.17](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/av/av14001.htm)). Roughly translated, _maha_ means "great," _mṛtyun_ means "death," and _jaya_ means "conquering." It is a beckoning to Śiva. This mantra has many purposed benefits but was given to me in the context of removing negative emotion associated with death.

### Yoga Yoga Yogeshwaraya Mantra

योग योग योगेश्वराय <br>
भूत भूत भूतेश्वराय <br>
काल काल कालेश्वराय <br>
शिव शिव सर्वेश्वराय <br>
शंभो शंभो महादेवाय

_Yoga Yoga Yogeshwaraya_<br>
_Bhuta Bhuta Bhuteshwaraya_<br>
_Kala Kala Kaleshwaraya_<br>
_Shiva Shiva Sarveshwaraya_<br>
_Shambho Shambho Mahadevaya_

This mantra pays homage to the five fundamental forms of Śiva.[^7] **_Yogeshwara_**: The process of _Yoga_ is to reach beyond the restraints of physical manifestation and touch what boundless. **_Bhuteshwara_**: The _pancha bhutas_, literally "five elements", account for all of creation. One who has mastered these five elements determines the destiny of his life in the physical realm. **_Kaleswaraya_**: _Kala_ means "time" and "darkness". The physical is bound to light and light to time. Therefore, time lies beyond the scope of the physical and must be mastered separately. **_Sarveshwara_**: _Shiva_ means "that which is not." It is the basis of everything. Even modern science is recognizing that the universe is about 68% dark energy and roughly 27% dark matter, meaning anything we can ever hope to see accounts for less than 5%.[^8] **_Shambho_**: The gentle form of Shiva. With Shiva's grace may we be granted a key. **_Maha_** means great and **_deva_** means deity or god.
