This mantra pays homage to the five fundamental forms of Śiva.[^1] **_Yogeshwara_**: The process of _Yoga_ is to reach beyond the restraints of physical manifestation and touch what boundless. **_Bhuteshwara_**: The _pancha bhutas_, literally "five elements", account for all of creation. One who has mastered these five elements determines the destiny of his life in the physical realm. **_Kaleswaraya_**: _Kala_ means "time" and "darkness". The physical is bound to light and light to time. Therefore, time lies beyond the scope of the physical and must be mastered separately. **_Sarveshwara_**: _Shiva_ means "that which is not." It is the basis of everything. Even modern science is recognizing that the universe is about 68% dark energy and roughly 27% dark matter, meaning anything we can ever hope to see accounts for less than 5%.[^2] **_Shambho_**: The gentle form of Shiva. With Shiva's grace may we be granted a key. _Maha_ means "great" and _deva_ means "deity" or "god".
