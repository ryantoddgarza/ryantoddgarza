My name is Ryan Todd Garza. I build practical systems to actualize creative concepts. I draw from a broad background of interdisciplinary pattern abstraction to develop effective technical and creative solutions for artistic and entrepreneurial ventures.

These systems typically manifest to address a specific need within a defined domain, and mature in a myriad of ways along the paths necessary for them to function where the seen and unforseen branches of those disciplines lead. This type of engagement has resulted in over a decade of creative and professional experience with countless clients and collaborators.

I began my career in the music industry as multi-instrumentalist in 2007. Throughout the following decade, I toured and recorded as a supporting musician, continued both formal and informal studies of Hindustani music, Afro-Cuban percussion, tonal and post tonal theory, and took on regular work as a recording/mixing engineer and eventually a producer.

Once I arrived in Los Angeles in 2015, the scope of my creative work expanded to include music and audio for the professional film industry. I've had the good fortune of working with incredibly talented individuals artistically on laurel winning independent films and commercially for some of the most iconic brands in the world including Apple, HULU, Reebok, Mercedes-Benz, Academy Sports + Outdoors, and many more.

In 2020, I founded the independent record label Inaminit Music to distribute my own recorded music and continue the development of a small number of artists and projects.
