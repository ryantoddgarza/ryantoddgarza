My audio engineering background naturally led to an exploration of sound synthesis and subsequently to the study of computational creativity and generative systems. For the first time, I encountered visual programming languages. Recognizing a conceptual expressiveness that personally felt wanting in traditional music notation systems, I turned my attention to lower level languages and shifted my focus to software development.

In 2021, I established Orthogonal Capital to more clearly articulate the scope of the solutions being pursued. Orthogonal Capital currently holds Bit Pasâ€”a creative development studio dedicated to modeling creative systems and exposing the results as unique user experiences.

I am currently engaged in the development of digital product solutions for startups and mid-scale businesses.

On a personal note, I enjoy movement disciplines and have an extensive Ashtanga Yoga background as well as a more recent infatuation with ballet. Daily learning is non-negotiable; I am perpetually in the middle of at least five books at any given time. I spent a brief season as a fine art photographer. I'm a night owl. My elementary principal told my parents I was a genius after I took an IQ test and I'm constantly on the fence about whether I am proving him right or wrong.
