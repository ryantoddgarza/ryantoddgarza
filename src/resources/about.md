My name is Ryan Todd Garza. I build practical systems to actualize creative concepts. I draw from a background of interdisciplinary experience as a software-engineer, music professional, photographer, dancer, and yogi to develop technical and creative solutions for artistic and entrepreneurial ventures.

While these systems typically manifest to address a need within a narrow domain, the requirements and thus the necessary skills often evolve as the system is required to function along seen and unforeseen paths. This type of engagement has resulted in over a decade of creative professional experience with countless clients and collaborators.

I began my career in the music industry as multi-instrumentalist in 2007. Throughout the following decade, I toured and recorded as a supporting musician, studied Hindustani music, Afro-Cuban percussion, tonal and post tonal theory, and took on regular work as a recording/mixing engineer and eventually as a producer.

In Los Angeles, the scope of my creative work expanded in 2015 to include music and audio for the professional film industry. I've had the good fortune of working artistically with incredibly talented individuals on laurelled independent films and commercially for some of the most iconic brands in the world including Apple, HULU, Reebok, Mercedes-Benz, and more.

My audio engineering background led to an exploration of sound synthesis and subsequently to the study of computational creativity and generative systems through the use of visual programming languages. In 2019 I transitioned to text-based programming languages and shifted my focus to software development. I remain involved in the development of digital solutions and the creation of digital property for startups and mid-scale businesses.

In 2020, I founded the independent record label Inaminit Music to distribute my own recorded music and to continue the development of select artists and projects. In 2021, I established Bit Pas—a creative development studio dedicated to modeling creative systems and exhibiting the output as unique user experiences. Through Bit Pas I am engaged in the development of creative systems in collaboration with local artists of varied disciplines. Late 2021 also saw the beginnings of Ashtanga Yoga Bhavana—a community cultivating the Eight Limbs of Yoga through the practice of Ashtanga Vinyasa Yoga.

2022 marked yet another crux in my path as I returned to the Texas Tech University Whitacre College of Engineering to finish my Bachelor of Science in computer science and, submitting to the momentum a newfound passion for dance, became a company dancer at Flatlands Dance Theatre. I've been accepted to study Gaga in Tel Aviv with its creator Ohad Naharin in the summer of 2022 and I gratefully anticipate opportunities to learn, collaborate, and share movement.

On a personal note, I have an extensive Ashtanga Yoga background as well as a more recent infatuation with rock climbing. Daily learning is non-negotiable. I am perpetually in the middle of at least five books at any given time. I'm a night owl. It is a goal of mine to finish the Collected Works of C. G. Jung. I spent a brief season as a fine art photographer. My elementary principal told my parents that I was a genius after taking an IQ test, but I can never really tell if I am proving him right or wrong.
