My name is Ryan Todd Garza. I build practical systems to actualize creative concepts. I draw from a broad background of interdisciplinary pattern abstraction to develop technical and creative solutions for artistic and entrepreneurial ventures.

While these systems typically manifest to address a specific need within a defined domain, they evolve along the paths necessary for them to function where the seen and unforeseen branches of the solution leads. This type of engagement has resulted in over a decade of creative professional experience with countless clients and collaborators.

I began my career in the music industry as multi-instrumentalist in 2007. Throughout the following decade, I toured and recorded as a supporting musician, continued both formal and informal studies of Hindustani music, Afro-Cuban percussion, tonal and post tonal theory, and took on regular work as a recording/mixing engineer and eventually a producer.

In Los Angeles, the scope of my creative work expanded in 2015 to include music and audio for the professional film industry. I've had the good fortune of working with incredibly talented individuals artistically on laurelled independent films and commercially for some of the most iconic brands in the world including Apple, HULU, Reebok, Mercedes-Benz, and more.

In 2020, I founded the independent record label Inaminit Music to distribute my own recorded music and to continue the development of a small number of artists and projects.

My audio engineering background naturally led to an exploration of sound synthesis and subsequently to the study of computational creativity and generative systems. For the first time, I encountered visual programming languages. I eventually turned my attention to text-based programming languages and shifted my primary focus to software development.

In 2021, I established Bit Pas—a creative development studio dedicated to modeling creative systems and exhibiting the output in unique user experiences. I am also engaged, on a per contract basis, in the development of digital solutions for startups and mid-scale businesses.

2022 marked yet another crux in my path as I returned to the Texas Tech University Whitacre College of Engineering to finish my Bachelor of Science in computer science, and—embracing the momentum of a newfound interest in dance—continued as a guest performer at Ballet Lubbock and a company member at Flatlands Dance Theatre.

On a personal note, I embrace movement culture and have an extensive Ashtanga Yoga background as well as a more recent infatuation with rock climbing. Daily learning is non-negotiable. I am perpetually in the middle of at least five books at any given time. I spent a brief season as a fine art photographer. I'm a night owl. My elementary principal told my parents that I was a genius after taking an IQ test, but I can never really tell if I am proving him right or wrong.
