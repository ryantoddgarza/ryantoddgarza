# Ens Ensemble

[Listen on Bandcamp →](https://ensensemble.bandcamp.com/)

ENS [ɛnz] noun, abstract being; existence, in the most abstract sense

Ens Ensemble is a moniker used by myself as an outlet to voice creative musical expressions regardless of the state of proficiency or perfection.

Following in the spirit of my teacher Art Lande, music as expression knows no right or wrong, good or bad, etc. when it comes from the musician in an un- [biased, tainted, restricted, constrained, impeded] way.

Intended as a nine week undertaking to create and release one track per day, each 'wk' collection is comprised of seven tracks. Plans to resume the project remain a mystery even to myself.

## Role

Programming, Synthesizer, Bansuri, Tabla, Percussion, Classical Guitar, Electric Guitar, Recording Engineer, Mixing, Design
