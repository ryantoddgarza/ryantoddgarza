## Where's the content?

This site is undergoing teardown so I can reflect and rebuild it in a way that more clearly articulates what it is that I do professionally and creatively while distinguishing current from past ventures.

## 01/ Software

If you are looking for my software and web work, you can view the public repositories containing my open-source services and libraries in my [personal GitHub](https://github.com/ryantoddgarza) as well as the [Bit Pas GitHub](https://github.com/bitpas)â€”my newly established creative development organization. There are also a handful of technical resources that I've written in my [blog](/categories/technology/1) and on [Medium](https://ryantoddgarza.medium.com/).

## 02/ Music

If you are looking for my music, you can stream it on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7IWzHdwu7JSvad216IyNoe), listen to [Ens Ensemble on Bandcamp](https://ensensemble.bandcamp.com/), or see my sparsely credited work on [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9906654/) and [AllMusic](https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ryan-todd-garza-mn0003848531). Those interested in theoretical rhythmic musings and the practical application of such can explore [my work on rhythmanalysis](https://github.com/ryantoddgarza/rhythmanalysis).

## 03/ Creative

If you are looking for my work regarding generative art and creative systems, check out [svara.dev](https://svara.dev). If my photography or past installations are what you came for, check back for an updated gallery or [email](mailto:ryantoddgarza@gmail.com) me about prints.

## 04/ Yoga

If you are looking for resources regarding Ashtanga Yoga asana, mantra, or simply explication of the philosophy and technique of systematic Yogic systems, my [blog](/categories/yoga/1) is still the best place for that.

## 05/ None of the above

If there is something else you are looking for that I haven't addressed, please [reach out](mailto:ryantoddgarza@gmail.com). I would love to know what brought you here and am always anticipating the conversation that instigates the next reason to learn something new.
